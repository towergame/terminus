		This is an idle game with a twist of randomness. You can play it like any other idle game. However, here are
		some explanations of some mechanics in the game:<br />
		Entropy Generator - generates bits of entropy<br />
		Recursive Generator - generates Entropy Generators<br />
		The cost scales with the formula of x * (1 + c)<sup>y/p</sup>, where:<br />
		x is the previous cost<br />
		c is a random number from 0 to 1<br />
		p is the amount of total entropic power + 1<br />
		y is the amount of purchased generators<br />
		<br />
		Don't worry if it jumps to infinity, because you'll be able to decrease the scaling of the cost by collecting
		more and more Entropic Power.
		<br />
		<b>Entropic Power</b> is the currency(?) used to combat the immense scaling of the cost for the Generators.
		However, the more Entropic Power you have, the harder it is to gain it.<br />
		The formula for entropic power gain is log(x / e<sup>y + 2</sup>), where:<br />
		x is bits generated this run<br />
		y is entropic power you have<br />
		e is Euler's number<br />
